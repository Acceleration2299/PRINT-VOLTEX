This is not going to be handled professionally, I'm a student who's stuck at home and wants to make stuff.

Before i can even build this project myself, i need to mark what parts i would need to be able to assemble anything electronic with this system.
As such, i will list off a very crude and simple bill of materials here.

ELECTRONICS:
A 3D Printer Motherboard running with STM32 processor (and preferably a USB Type B, Mini B, Micro B, or Type C connector)
7 SANWA OBSF-24 arcade pushbutton switches
2 NEMA-17 Stepper Motors, Size doesn't really matter other then for your build size. I'm using the ones Creality supplies for the Z axis leadscrew(s)
2 Stepper Drivers, preferably NOT TMC. (if your motherboard does not come with stepper drivers built in)
7 JST XH 2 pin connectors, for plugging loose wires into the MCU
2 JST XH 4 pin connectors, for plugging Stepper Motors into the MCU, (Your motors may come with them attached, or you may have to go to the weird 6 pin standard that some motors use, i don't recall)
24AWG wire, preferably stranded. have both wire in Red and Black for "Sensor" and "GND" to avoid confusion and crimping connectors backwards.
NOTE: Many printer boards use 3 pin endstop ports, if we look at a connector with the lock tab north, the left pin is Signal, the Middle is GND, and the right is 5V. Pay attention to this, I don't want you to smoke your stuff.

CHASSIS:
The MCU identifies when a switch is opened or closed by determining if the sensor pin you configured it to use is in contact with GND. 
Therefore, whatever you mount your motherboard to should be metal, with (likely M3) standoffs, so that everything is connected to the same ground.
Beyond that, you really just need Wood, Acrylic, 3D Printer filament of your choosing, sheet metal if you can get it.
