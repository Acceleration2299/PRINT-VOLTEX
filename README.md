Welcome to the PRINT VOLTEX Repository

This document will include Source code (and binaries for Creality 4.3.1) for STM32 MCU's.
It will also encompass a couple CAD drawings on how you can either; print, laser cut, 
CNC Machine, or otherwise manufacture the Chassis required for the project.

The barrier to entry for SDVX is too high, so i'd like to reduce it at least a little bit.

I have recently learned, that creality, in their infinite wisdom, decided to not route the
BOOT0 pin to literally anything, so i will have to rely on a lot of SD Card file tranfers
and severe headaches to get this to work.
